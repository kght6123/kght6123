#### 👶 About Me

I am a father of two who enjoys web front-end development. Recently, I've been mainly using TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.

I'll be working an average of 1-3 hours a day, but I'm looking for a repository where I can improve my skills or contribute as a side job. (as of 2024)

#### 🛠️ Skills

This is a level where you can read code and develop common components and applications.

- React.js/Next.js
- Vue.js/Nuxt.js: Vue.js 2.x, Nuxt.js 2.x only. 
- jQuery/Bootstrap/jQuery UI

I am very knowledgeable about Tailwind CSS.

#### 📘 Doujinshi (Self-Published Book)

I'm currently writing a doujinshi about Tailwind CSS!
